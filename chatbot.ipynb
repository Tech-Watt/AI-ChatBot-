That\\'s correct\"},{\"prompt\":\" which is what i was doing\",\"completion\":\" Yes this is a preview, you build the zap on Zapier.  That\\'s why we redirect you there.  So add your trigger as Typeform.  And then BHuman with the generate video event\"},{\"prompt\":\" im to this point...got an error. .  started with typeform...connected typeform...and then connected bhuman. \",\"completion\":\" Can you send me screenshots of the steps before this?.

You can click the dropdown and choose the template you just selected\"},{\"prompt\":\" oh ok.  it said a video was generaated.  and sent to bhuman...but where do I find it?\",\"completion\":\" So this sent your video to start generating.  However it takes 2-3mins for your video to complete.  So now you need to add a 3rd step to your flow, to send the video somewhere\"},{\"prompt\":\" add a step in Zapier?\",\"completion\":\" Yup! .  https://scribehow.com/shared/Recover_abandoned_carts_with_BHuman__y_V_4gWDRTaoql_Klj1Sxg#14123f0a.

On the platform you can also do it by passing the vimeo link to a landing page platform, and making that embed dynamically. However it would not be instant..  The other alternative is to pre-render the videos in advance, so they can be shown instantly\"},{\"prompt\":\" how much is enterprise?\",\"completion\":\" Can you tell me the use case more specifically? The whole point of this is to make your customers feel like you just recorded a video for them. This would not be possible to show instantly.

You\\'d need to use the spreadsheet.  You can input a list of common names, click generate, and then download the resulting file as a CSV which you can put into your database to show your audience instantly\"},{\"prompt\":\" how would it know to select the right name?\",\"completion\":\" That depends on your page, we can\\'t control that. However, we do offer professional services to build something like this for you.\"},{\"prompt\":\" how much?.  the whole rendering thing is a bust\",\"completion\":\" For a simple landing page where a user selects their name and the corresponding video shows, I estimate 7.5 hours of professional services. That\\'s going to cost $937.5 + the additional rendering fees (39 cents per video).  What do you mean a bust?\"},{\"prompt\":\" i wanted 1000 videos for $99...use my Typeform to collect names...and instanly us the video to send to a page to collect additional information - but it wont work - LOL\",\"completion\":\" Well there\\'s a path to do that like I said :).  I can walk you through it verbally, or you can have us build it for you\"},{\"prompt\":\" you said Instant is on enterprise .  thats not at the $99 pricepoint advertised\",\"completion\":\" To do that you\\'d need to: 1. Upload / film / select your template 2. Enter a list of common names into the spreadsheet 3. Generate 4. Download results as CSV 5. Upload CSV to a website platform which will show the video based on the user\\'s selection (that\\'s not in our control).  $99 for 1,000 videos generated. We never promise instant videos on our platform..  We don\\'t have a single user who has asked for instant videos, just so you know, because it doesn\\'t tell the right story of someone filming a video personally for you\"},{\"prompt\":\" ok i guess I asumed instant - didnt say anyting about rendering time\",\"completion\":\" Oh I see, well we have really advanced AI that needs to process each video. So it does take time unfortunately\"},{\"prompt\":\" what are all the things I can to with the video? I basically want the video inside or outside another typeform to gather additional info\",\"completion\":\" So what I recommend is adding a gmail step to send the video in an email, and in the video you can say Hey Name, some words here... To continue, fill out the form linked in this email.  Can you tell me the exact use case & what business goal you\\'re trying to achieve?\"},{\"prompt\":\" ok that could work\",\"completion\":\" I can help recommend a strategy\"},{\"prompt\":\" keep it simple.  ok I am listening.  for your strategy\",\"completion\":\" What\\'s your business objective?\"},{\"prompt\":\" I am having new affiliates signup (using initial typeform) - create a custom video(bhuman)...send that video to new affiliate and have them complete another typeform for additinal info\",\"completion\":\" Ok got it, and just so I know, what are the forms about?.  Because you can incentivize them by offering some sort of personalized advice in the video, perhaps\"},{\"prompt\":\" being an affiliate of ours means they will generate leads for us\",\"completion\":\" So the first form is very high level and the second form gets more in depth?\"},{\"prompt\":\" yes, I can give them additional incentives...but I just need to know the basics first.  first form is to have them sign up - the 2nd form is to tell us where they are going to market for us\",\"completion\":\" Ok got it.  Great, so it sounds like we have your flow then!.  n Zapier trigger when they fill out a form n Generate BHuman video n Send via Gmail with link to 2nd form n n\"},{\"prompt\":\" does the video play in the email?.  or is it taken to a page?.  what page is it taken to?.  I need this page to have the 2nd typeform\",\"completion\":\" And for the video script, I recommend something like: Hey name [pause], Xavier here -- I just got notified that you filled out our affiliate form. Your profile looks good, so I\\'d like to invite you to continue the process and complete the Onboarding Form, which I\\'ll add a link to in this message.....  The video is a Vimeo.com link.  So they click on it and it open up to that.  And you link the form in the email\"},{\"prompt\":\" so the email will take them to vimeo...then i need them to go to typform...seems like alot f clicking around\",\"completion\":\" No, it\\'s not\"},{\"prompt\":\" i was hoping to have it all on 1  page\",\"completion\":\" Inside the email is a video link, they click it to watch the video. All they need to do is go back to the email tab and click the 2nd typeform link.  We can put it all on one page for you, but that\\'s an enterprise service because it\\'s a custom, additional service\"},{\"prompt\":\" ok understood.  so each person will receive a different rendered video right?.  how long will it take to render?\",\"completion\":\" Yes exactly, all personalized.  About 2-3 minutes\"},{\"prompt\":\" and how do i set it up to send when the video is done rendering.  do i need a special vimeo account for this?\",\"completion\":\" Well when you add a 3rd step in Zapier, all that will happen automatically.  When a typeform is submitted, BHuman will fire up and generate your video and it will be sent right away after that.  Nope! No Vimeo account required from your side\"},{\"prompt\":\" interesting\",\"completion\":\" Sounds good Xavier! Well unfortunately I have to run now, but just add a reply here and I\\'ll see it later & get back to you\"},{\"prompt\":\" where do I add the script you wrote for me?\",\"completion\":\" And you can find everything you need to know about setting up Zapier here  https://scribehow.com/shared/Recover_abandoned_carts_with_BHuman__y_V_4gWDRTaoql_Klj1Sxg#1c933341.

And what if there are several scripts..  Like one client might have a problem that deals in one aspect of marketing, another might have a problem that deals with website speed, another might have a problem with landing page copy, is there a way to jump from script to script and perhaps include some other visuals.  Like if I could include dynamic images that would be huge.  Over even combine the intro with another video at the end that would be great. Like an intro and a presentation.  Think on that. I am going to be back in 15 minutes.  Ok, Im back. Have to wait for my car to warm up.  ok\",\"completion\":\" Once account is created and you have decided which plan to upgrade to, you may start generating videos.  You should have separate recording for each script. As you\\'ll need to highlight and add variables (lets say names) for each script separately.

I\\'m still unable to synch the variable with the rest of the video. A peer of mine was able to do it successfully but using the same variable (Hi name) but was standing further back from the camera. I\\'d like to try that but I\\'d need to redo the voice training for it to match since the first time the mic was close to me.\",\"completion\":\" Hey Stephen! Yes you can. You only have to go to Clone myself - Select the actor you want delete (It probably appear a window, you need to click out of it) and there you have 3 options.  One of those is delete actor. .  Not the marked, the last one\"},{\"prompt\":\" Thank you.  Hi, now that Iâ€™ve tried several more attempts testing different elements I wanted to get some more help / advice. n Following the advice to record in the same room as the voice training, to position myself 3 feet from the camera, and allow space for the variable, this is an example of what I got:. .  I was unable to get it to look and sound anywhere near as well synched as the samples on your site. I also tried manually recording the â€œHi nameâ€\\x9d variable but it wasnâ€™t significantly better. n That said, Iâ€™d be perfectly happy with this quality (this is an associate of mine):. .  Youâ€™ll see that the audio synching is much better with his. And because he is positioned far back from his phone, any issues lip synching in the video arenâ€™t noticeable because his mouth is so far away from the camera. n I just tried another attempt where I also sat far away from the phone, however the audio in the variable sounded even more different than the rest of the video, which makes sense because I did the voice training close to my computer but the audio recorded on my phone was from much farther away. n Do you have any suggestions to close the gap so that I can get my video to look and sound of similar quality to his? Enough distance may solve the visual incongruity of the mouth / lips in the variable, but what would be the best way to get the audio of the variable to sound closer to the rest of the videoâ€™s audio (especially since one must be close to the computer to stop, start, and read the voice training phrases). n Thanks\",\"completion\":\" Hi Stephen, Julia here.  reading over this now!.  I think the reason your personalized variable pulled more of the sentence instead of just hey name is because there wasnt a long enough pause after saying hi name.  Variables are short phrases surrounded by pauses. For example: hey name pause...etc etc...we love company pause...etc etc.... n n Sometimes users try to pause only around the variable like hey pause name pause .... we dont suggest doing that because it will look less natural. .  that is a pretty cool way your associate did it, not a bad idea to go far away and with that lighting. A more advanced lip/face cloning model is coming so lips should look more natural very soon, but for now we do want that distance. n n Regarding your video, I think because your lighting is bright and well lit all around its easier to see your mouth. We recommend low lighting, something more like you associate\\'s not that you have to be that far away lol!.  Everyones face is different along with their voice. Playing around with our AI is really like trying to get a good photo of yourself for your social media accounts.

I\\'m not sure how it came out sounding so consistent for him.\",\"completion\":\" After talking to our founder, he let me know a mobile app is about 2 months away, yay! - that means you will be able to train your voice and film on your phone so that audio is exactly the same. n n He also let me know that a quick workaround fix while we are waiting for the app is to have you use headphones that can connect to your computer and phone. So if you use headphones that either have a longer cord or are bluetooth then you can make sure you have that distance while filming from your phone as well..  I would say you can also re-train the sentences and be the distance away that you\\'ll film.  hope that im making sense!\"},{\"prompt\":\" Ok, love the headphones idea.

These are saved to your Actor, so when they come up again, you don\\'t need to re-record anything. ï»¿ ï»¿The nice thing about first names, for example, is that they repeat all the time. About 80% of all people have 1 of 1,500 names, depending on the language. So, once you take 20-30 minutes to record the most common names in your region, they will repeat most of the time, and you won\\'t need to record anything again. ï»¿ ï»¿We are planning to add non-English languages to voice cloning in the mid-term future, but we don\\'t have anything immediately coming up. .

Is that works in Portuguese language?\",\"completion\":\" BHuman typically replies in a few hours..  Give Don and the team a way to reach you:.  Yes, there, BHuman can work in virtually any language. Right now voice cloning only works in English, however, there is a workaround where you can record variables manually. This can be done using the microphone button on the spreadsheet. These are saved to your Actor, so when they come up again, you don\\'t need to re-record anything. ï»¿ ï»¿The nice thing about first names, for example, is that they repeat all the time. About 80% of all people have 1 of 1,500 names, depending on the language. So, once you take 20-30 minutes to record the most common names in your region, they will repeat most of the time, and you won\\'t need to record anything again. ï»¿ ï»¿We are planning to add non-English languages to voice cloning in the mid-term future, but we don\\'t have anything immediately coming up. \"}, {\"prompt\":\" just signed up\",\"completion\":\" BHuman typically replies in a few hours..

[pause] We crush it {industry}, [pause] helping companies build a social media presence and stay top of mind in your industry. n n I have some ideas Iâ€™d love to discuss on a quick call. Whoâ€™s the best person to discuss this with?.  So, I\\'d avoid company names because a lot of company names are play on words / require correct pronunciation, etc.. Which the AI won\\'t know. It will just pronounce it phonetically. For example I need to feed it Be Human to get the right pronunciation of BHuman, with the current model.  What I\\'d also do in your campaign is add background mode, so we\\'d put the customer\\'s website or linkedin profile on a screenshare\"},{\"prompt\":\" That makes sense\",\"completion\":\" And then you can alter your script to, I\\'m looking at your site, I have some ideas....  The thumbnail of someone seeing their site or Linkedin will also drive up CTR a lot\"},{\"prompt\":\" Can the AI generate that for us? \",\"completion\":\" Yup.  Just feed us the site or linkedin URL in a spreadsheet / API call\"},{\"prompt\":\" Do you have a tutorial on that? .  Or is it literally just adding the LinkedIN URL in the sheet just like the names and the AI will do the rest? \",\"completion\":\" It\\'s not on the platform yet, but it\\'s available for enterprise .  But yes exactly\"},{\"prompt\":\" We\\'ll get enterprise so that\\'s alright. \",\"completion\":\" You can even mix and match things, so - show website from 0-5seconds, then linkedin from 5-12, then this video I upload from 12-30, etc.  Yup, before a feature hits the platform we have it running on enterprise for early access\"},{\"prompt\":\" Where will those things show that you mention? .  Is that just the thumbnail or somewhere else?\",\"completion\":\" The thumbnail and then in the video itself of course.  I\\'ll show you an example\"},{\"prompt\":\" That would be great! \",\"completion\":\" https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wYLPg8WT6Qz0VhIAZ-V0K0mfcGfbBiC6/view.

I\\'ll pay for the 1800 videos no problem, but I think having a thumbnail with their business page on it will make a big difference in results. .  Also, having html code like that can have a big impact on the deliverability of the email. Do you have any stats of someone who tried it at scale? \",\"completion\":\" The background mode isn\\'t on the platform yet, so we\\'d give you access to it via a custom API we set up for you.  Definitely, the thumbnail is a huge difference.  Yeah, as you surely know deliverability is determined by a lot of things: - sender IP, domain, subject, content keywords, email weight, open rates, time spent on email, response rate, etc....  It\\'s true embedding the thumbnail adds to the email weight.  However the open rate, time spent on email, CTR and response rates are so high.  That deliverability tends to be fine or even increase.  We haven\\'t seen any issues with it.  Now, if your offer is terrible and you don\\'t write a compelling email and nobody engages with it, of course then it will hurt deliverability because of the added weight\"},{\"prompt\":\" Great! But the thumbnail feature is on the platform already?  And what reply rate are we talking about? \",\"completion\":\" Deliverability is such a sensitive thing, so we recommend everyone tests it.  Totally depends on your data, offer, content, etc... of course, but we have seen 10-20% reply rates.  Thumbnail feature will be provided with the enterprise plan. We do provide a thumbnail right now but it\\'s just a pic of the actor, no background\"},{\"prompt\":\" So we can\\'t test that yet? \",\"completion\":\" Not any custom backgrounds until we set it up for you with a custom API.  But we do plan on having background mode in the platform in about a week so you can use it their natively\"},{\"prompt\":\" Got it!\",\"completion\":\" Awesome\"},{\"prompt\":\" Just tried it with a new video and it says failed again.  And in this video she paused way to long, so I already asked her to record a new video.  But it should make it easier for the AI\",\"completion\":\" Let me log into your account just a moment\"},{\"prompt\":\" Sure\",\"completion\":\" Found the issue. . .  So the actor with the voice clone is not the actor selected.  I\\'ll make the switch for you\"},{\"prompt\":\" Oh I see.  Alright, let me know if it\\'s switched\",\"completion\":\" Just switched it and named the template Don template.  Generating now\"},{\"prompt\":\" I don\\'t see it.

You can make that video before uploading it to the platform.  So you have a video file which shows your face when you say variables and speech, then it cuts to show the appliances as you\\'d like.

Haha.  We would automate the whole process you plan to do on Clipchamp\"},{\"prompt\":\" I need alot of control on how images and videos come in, theres a creative element to it that i want to keep.  I wish you had an example.  like if its an outdoor pizza oven.  what exactly would you automate\",\"completion\":\" So you have 2 videos, right.  The video of your CEO.  And the video from the manufacturer.  And you have hundreds of pairs of these videos.  So we could write a script that would automatically insert mfg video at X seconds of your CEO video, and then go back to your CEO at Y seconds, etc....  In this way we could batch create all your videos at once\"},{\"prompt\":\" it would be produt and video dependent and it would probably be multiple manufacturer videos and images at different instances of when he speaks about the specific feature\",\"completion\":\" I see.

We clone your voice so that you can create AI videos in an automated fashion.  - We make sending really easy: With Send it For Me, you can send videos over email or SMS directly from the platform in just a few clicks - LInkedin automation: You can also send over Linkedin messenger, directly from the platform\"},{\"prompt\":\" Thank you for writing that all out man!.

Even though I sat in the exact same place in the room with both devices in front of me the sound on the NEW TEST video is very different between the real audio and the AI bit - almost like you need to apply some artificial noise to the AI part or noise cancellation to the real part..  You need to be able to do the voice training on the phone too.

What can I help with?\"},{\"prompt\":\" Hi there, i was wondering if I could use Bhuman also in Dutch (language) .  I don\\'t mind saying the word Name at the start of my video. but I\\'m afraid BHuman is using an English pronounciation for typically Dutch names \",\"completion\":\" Yes, Sacha, BHuman can work in virtually any language. Right now voice cloning only works in English, however, there is a workaround where you can record variables manually. This can be done using the microphone button on the spreadsheet. These are saved to your Actor, so when they come up again, you don\\'t need to re-record anything. ï»¿ ï»¿The nice thing about first names, for example, is that they repeat all the time. About 80% of all people have 1 of 1,500 names, depending on the language. So, once you take 20-30 minutes to record the most common names in your region, they will repeat most of the time, and you won\\'t need to record anything again. ï»¿ ï»¿We are planning to add non-English languages to voice cloning in the mid-term future, but we don\\'t have anything immediately coming up. \"},{\"prompt\":\" Hi Julia, Thanks for your quick reply.

Hi, Enzo, BHuman can work in virtually any language. Right now voice cloning only works in English, however, there is a workaround where you can record variables manually. This can be done using the microphone button on the spreadsheet. These are saved to your Actor, so when they come up again, you don\\'t need to re-record anything. ï»¿ ï»¿The nice thing about first names, for example, is that they repeat all the time. About 80% of all people have 1 of 1,500 names, depending on the language. So, once you take 20-30 minutes to record the most common names in your region, they will repeat most of the time, and you won\\'t need to record anything again. ï»¿ ï»¿We are planning to add non-English languages to voice cloning in the mid-term future, but we don\\'t have anything immediately coming up. \"}, {\"prompt\":\" Need walkthrough\",\"completion\":\" You\\'ve got it.

Make your variable phrase the whole segment, Hi Name, not just the name part. You\\'ll get the best results when you replace phrases. 4. Record your voice cloning training phrases in the same room, on the same mic, at the same volume, as you record your video. To clone a new voice, please create a new actor profile and train it there.

When recording your own varibales you can use BHuman in any language you would like. However voice cloning is currently only available in English (see below exception).

As a workaround for the voice cloning model, you may start your videos off with our most common variable Hey Name in English and record the rest of your video in your own language. As long as the variable highlighted is recorded in English, you can speak in any language for the rest of the video. An example would be: EXAMPLE: Hey name, mi chiamo Anna e lavoro per WWF. Vorrei poterle parlare di persona, per ringraziarla della sua donazione incredibilmente generosa. * You can also make the AI model say, ciao or bonjour, for example, but we can\\'t guarantee pronunciation is going to be perfect! .

So, once you take 20-30 minutes to record the most common names in your region, they will repeat most of the time, and you won\\'t need to record anything again.

We recommend training your voice and filming in the same room, as well as being at least 3-4 feet away from the camera. Playing around with the lighting is also key.
